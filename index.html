        <p lang="en-us">
          <!--introduction-->
          Firing clay transforms it from its humble, soft beginnings into a new, durable substance: ceramic. Ceramics are tough 
          and strong and similar in some ways to stone. Pieces of pottery have survived for thousands of years, all because clay
          met fire. The temperature needed to transform soft clay into hard ceramic is extremely high and is usually provided by
          a kiln. You cannot fire pottery in a home oven because ovens do not get up to the high temperatures of more than
          1,500 degrees Fahrenheit that you need for firing clay. Firing is the process of bringing clay and glazes up to a 
          high temperature.The final aim is to heat the object to the point that the clay and glazes are "mature"â€”that is, 
          that they have reached their optimal level of melting. To the human eye, pots and other clay objects do not look 
          melted; the melting that occurs is on the molecular level. This process is usually accomplished in two steps: 
          bisque firing and glaze firing.

    <h2 class="important">Electric Firing</h2>
        <p lang="en-us">
          <!--first section on a specific kind of firing-->
          Bisque firing typically takes place in an electric kiln. Though low fire glaze ware may be fired in them as well.
          Heat in an electric kiln is transferred in three ways:
          1.) conduction heat transferred through physical contact
          2.) convection heat rising through the air
          3.) radiation heat emanating from all the kiln elements.
          Electricity passing through coiled heating elements (made especially for high temperatures) generates radiant heat,
          which rises and is absorbed by everything in the kiln.

    <h2 class="important">Raku Firing</h2 class="important">
        <p lang="en-us">
          <!--second section on a specific kind of firing-->
          Raku generally refers to a type of low-firing process that was inspired by traditional Japanese raku firing.
          Western-style raku usually involves removing pottery from the kiln while at bright red heat and placing it into 
          containers with combustible materials such as paper, leaves, and horsehair. This method produces very unique glaze 
          patterns but is not food safe.
        </p>
    <h2 class="important">Gas Firing</h2>
        <p lang="en-us">
          <!--third section on a specific kind of firing-->
          Gas reduction firing uses a fuel, such as natural gas or propane. The temperatures of a gas fired reduction kiln may
          exceed 2300F, when the glazes melt and mature. Because gas is a combustible fuel, the potter can control the ratio 
          of oxygen to gas during the firing. Depriving the kiln of oxygen creates an atmosphere known as reduction, where 
          carbon monoxide can be produced.  By reducing the oxygen during this refractory process, the glaze colors will 
          change and become enhanced. This can only occur in fuel fired kilns.It is the burning of chemically combined oxygen
          in the clay and glaze minerals that gives reduction fired pottery its unique characteristics.

    <h2 class="important">Salt and Soda Firing</h2>
        <p lang="en-us">
          <!--fourth section on a specific kind of firing-->
          Salt firing is a vapor-glazing process where salt (sodium chloride) is introduced into kiln firebox at high 
          temperature. The salt vaporizes, and sodium vapor combines with silica in clay surface, forming extremely hard
          sodium-silicate glaze.  In the soda firing process, soda ash (sodium carbonate) in water solution, instead of salt, is
          sprayed into kiln at maturing temperature, and sodium vapor combines with silica in clay to form sodium-silicate glaze.
